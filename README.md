Media Computation in Strype
===

This library allows use of the media computation functions and images in the Strype editor.

Importing
---
To use this media computation library in Strype, copy the following two lines (for example, using the button top-right in the grey box):

```
#(=> Library:github:k-pet-group/mediacomp-strype
from mediacomp import * 
```

Then in Strype, position your blue frame cursor at the very top of the file, in the imports section, and paste (Ctrl-V on Windows, Cmd-V on Mac).
